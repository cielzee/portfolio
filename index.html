                                    I’m an experienced full-stack developer with a software engineering background and a passion for product, user experience & design. I’m excited about the opportunity to leverage all that I’ve learned as a developer in a new role as a product manager or
                                    technical product manager.<br><br> I've had extensive development experience in corporate companies, consulting agencies, and start up environments. During my time in startup environments,
                                    I've found that I enjoy gathering requirements and flushing out details that weren't previously thought of. During my time at Pivotal Labs as a software engineer, I gained invaluable exposure and experience with the
                                    entire lifecycle of a product - from defining the problem and validating the solution with user research, usability testing, prioritizing features using feedback from our users, to the development cycle - designing
                                    and implementing features.<br><br> I take pride in solving problems, writing and designing clean, testable code, have a solid understanding of design patterns and architecture, and am fluent agile methodologies. I like
                                    finding solutions, whether it be through the code I'm writing, or having someone describe a problem to me or specify requirements and having to design a solution. I'm always looking for ways to make our team run more
                                    efficiently, and thoroughly enjoy having ownership of the features I develop - from its start as a feature description, to writing user stories, to shipped code.<br><br>

                            <span class="subtitle">Discovery & framing:</span> Our client initially described the problem to us as "everyone on the news team gets too much email". Every news team employee was constanty managing a large daily influx of
                            emails, because was the primary form of communication. Further adding to that load were the distribution email lists employees were included in, some that were mandatory for all employees and others that were mandatory varying
                            by department. We hypothesized that the real issue at hand was a workflow problem, and the emails were a symptom of it. I worked alongside 1 product designer, 1 product manager, and 1 other developer, as well as our client
                            stakeholders, to validate our problem. We started by identifying 3 distinct demographics of our users - cutting producers, senior producers, and field correspondents - and getting a comprehensive understanding of their day
                            to day activities and interactions by going through a detailed service blueprint. We identified at which points in each of our persona's days we thought communication became hard for our users to manage. After conducting user
                            research with 15 news team employees fitting our personas and synthesizing data from our interviews, key insights began to surface. <br><br>

                            <span class="subtitle">Problem:</span> The news team manages all aspects of news production - from initial pitch, to assets, drafts, and final cuts - over email. This makes it hard for anyone involved to manage changes and
                            updates to the story, and also limits visibility to only those working on that story. An important email could easily be missed, or a relevant person be accidentally excluded from an update, and a lot of work was being duplicated.<br><br>
                            <span class="subtitle">Solution:</span> Our solution was a collaborative web application centered around stories, the core product of the news team. News employees would be able to see a list of all stories currently in progress,
                            and close out stories when they were finished. Employees would be given permissions to edit and take action on stories they were assigned to, allowing them to add comments, assets, and include other employees.

                            <span class="subtitle">Product: </span> my vision of a solution to the problems I experience when using yelp. A food review app that utilizes positive reinforcement from users and constructive feedback and in turn, fosters
                            a more positive business relationship with restaurants. <br><br> There are 2 problems I perceive with Yelp's user experience, splitting user groups by restaurant goers (consumers) and restaurant owners. Personally, as a consumer,
                            when I look at a restaurant's Yelp page, I'm trying to determine what to order and what other people usually order at this restaurant. This information isn't easily visible because of the way Yelp structures its rating/review
                            system. A restaurant's ratings and public perception could be potentially skewed by negative reviews that usually have more to do with the service the reviewer recieved than the food itself. My solution is an app where dishes
                            are ranked within a restaurant by a 'like' system, allowing the most popular dishes to float to the top of the page. The restaurant itself can be rated on points such as service, quality, price, etc., but these ratings would
                            be separated from the dishes they offer.<br><br> On the other hand, many small businesses have negative relationships with Yelp due to Yelp's business model. Yelp uses its ranking system as a way to collect revenue from businesses,
                            and some businesses refuse to pay to filter negative reviews or their search ranking and consequently see their profile negatively affected. Chefs especially perceive Yelp to be a one way relationship, where users passive aggressively
                            vent out negative feedback. Businesses are not given the opportunity to respond to reviewers unless they purchase an additional features from Yelp. A compilation of complaints from the FTC revealed that 'the most common complaints
                            claim that Yelp filters out positive reviews and allows negative reviews through, especially in cases where the vendor in question did not purchase advertising.' If that's not a flawed business model, I don't know what is.
                            I'd like to see a system in which reviews of a restaurant's food are truly reflective of what they offer, and a more transparent business model that doesn't rely on fraudulent reviews.

                            how a feature should behave when given a general idea of what the founders wanted to see. One particular feature I oversaw was resume parsing, in which a user uploads their resume as the first step of their application. Using
                            a 3rd party resume parsing service (Sovreign), we attempt to fill out as much of their application as we can. I was involved in every step of this process, from designing and improving the user interface, to flowcharting the
                            user experience, to fully implementing the feature. The screenshots shown are the first few steps of each user flow - for employers, filling out a job posting and for candidates, filling out an application.
